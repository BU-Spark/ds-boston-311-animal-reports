What is the project focus/overall goal?
There are a few goals of this project including:
- Identifying which animals are most prevalent in animal report cases across 311’s Service Request datasets 
- Create graphical representation of animal reports across the Boston area in form of heat maps or point density map  
- Create time series illustrating change in animal abundance in area over time 

Why is this project important?
This project will provide valuable insight to the city of Boston with regards to which animals are the greatest nuisance to civilians, and where and when they are most prevalent. As such, the city can take the appropriate measures in mitigating the animals’ presence in the respective areas. 

What type of data will you collect or be analyzing?
We will use csv files of 311 Service Requests for our datasets, then filter for requests pertaining to “animal issues” and other important features of these rows, such as longitude and latitude, location, date, etc. 

What are potential limitations of the project?
Since the 311 Service Requests are civilian submitted requests, biases may exist in the data. These include language barriers, who the submitter of the request is, and where they are located. 

What are your next steps? Divide tasks amongst the team
Our next step is to clean and preprocess the existing datasets so they only contain requests pertaining to animal issues. The next step would be to begin an early insights report, this includes creating a preliminary analysis of the data i.e. beginning the process of calculating the prevalence of various animals in the datasets. We will also assess the quality of our data and ensure it meets the qualifications of answering the questions posed by the client and project.
