## Team Accomplishments
### Base Analysis
Objective: Gain insights into the trends and patterns in animal complaints to improve the 311 service’s effectiveness.

 - Trend Analysis: Evaluated animal report volumes from October 2013 to present to assess whether complaint frequency is increasing, stable, or decreasing.
 - Animal Type Analysis: Identified which animals are most commonly involved in complaints, aiding in resource prioritization for the 311 service.
 - Geographic Distribution: Analyzed the locations of complaints across Boston to pinpoint high-incident areas, informing targeted interventions.
 - Temporal Analysis: Examined how seasonal changes and times of day affect complaint patterns, allowing for optimized staffing and resource allocation.
### Extension Analysis 
Objective: Delve deeper into the data to uncover nuanced insights that address complex dynamics influencing animal complaints.

- Hourly and Seasonal Variation: Investigated how the frequency of animal complaints varies by hour and across different seasons. This analysis helps understand peak times and seasons for different types of animal incidents, enabling tailored response strategies.
- Spatial and Geographic Correlations: Analyzed the correlation between animal report frequencies and their proximity to parks. This included studying the spatial distribution across Boston’s neighborhoods to understand the environmental and urban factors affecting animal complaints.
- Predictive Modeling: Developed a SARIMA model to forecast the number of animal reports by month, assisting the city in proactive resource planning and operational adjustments.
- Community Engagement and Reliability: Evaluated the impact of 311 services over time on community engagement by analyzing the trends in opened and closed cases, providing a measure of the department's responsiveness and effectiveness.
