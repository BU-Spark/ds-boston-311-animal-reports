dog,Case Closed. Closed date : 2020-10-27 13:59:29.783 Case Resolved Animal Care and Control has received numerous complaints about this address. The dog owner has been spoken to on numerous occasions and at this point is willing to participate in a nuisance hearing (MGL c 140 sec 157). The dog owner states that the concerns are unfounded and the responding animal control officers have not found the dogs to be barking to create a nuisance- neither has the CSO for this district. We have spoken to at least one neighbor about this concern  as recently as last week  and that person did not identify the address as a source of nuisance barking.   A  resident called earlier today expressing concern that nothing has been done to address the situation. The 311 call taker conferenced me in and advised the resident that I was on the line. The resident was advised that he could remain anonymous by myself and by the 311 staff member  but he refused to speak with me. I tried to explain that we needed more information  but it appeared that the call was disconnected.   The dog owner has expressed that he feels that he is being harassed by the multiple interactions from the Division.

The concerns communicated appear to be more serious in nature  but are outside the Divisionâs purview. I offered to contact City Council on callerâs behalf  caller declined the offer.
