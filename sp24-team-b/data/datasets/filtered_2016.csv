Upon arrival  she attempted to make contact with the resident and there was no answer. The officer reported that she would standby while AC&C attempted to reach the resident by phone. AC&C called twice-no answer-left a voicemail. Early this morning  the animal control officer received a call from 311 to assist at this address again. 311 received additional information and at that time a decision to not respond and to instead send the Boston Police was made.
