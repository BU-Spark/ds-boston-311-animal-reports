Project Summary:
The city of Boston is interested in a report regarding the nature of animal complaints on the cityâ€™s 311 app. This includes the number of complaints, kinds of animals, distinct geographic areas where animal complaints are common, and trends in said complaints (such as season, or weather). 

Navigation:

 The repository is broken down into two main folders, data & deliverables.

 The data sub directory contains all python scripts we created for each aspect of the project, which includes the following (found in the folder named scripts):
 * Cleaning our datasets, which were accessed via Analyze Boston 311's service request logs, which can be found here: https://data.boston.gov/dataset/311-service-requests
 * Our polished datasets can be found within the datasets folder inside of the data sub directory
 * The creation of each of our scripts used to extract data from our datasets to answer our base and extension analysis questions, these scripts can be found in the scripts folder of the data sub directory
 * The creation of each of our scripts used to visualize the extracted information for each question
 * Our interactive heatmaps created using ArcGIS (a link to this story map is provided in the written final report found in the deliverables folder)

 The visuals that correspond to each of the scripts that produce images can be found within the visuals folder within data sub directory.

 To run any of the python scripts within the scripts folder, make note of the imports at the top of each file (download the latest version of said import), along with the comments provided in each python file to help guide you in running these scripts. They mainly only require you to set up your system path to allow the script to appropriately grab or send the datasets/created datasets and or scripts. 

 The deliverables sub directory contains all deliverable content that was presented to the client or submitted on Gradescope. These include:
 * Early Insights (Written Report & Slide Deck)
 * Mid-Semester Report Slide Deck (the video is not included in the repository due to the file size, but is available in the drive at this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19yUfpsxsUvbFueCZk-NomRjqukvR8iVq)
 * Final Report (Written Report & Slide Deck)
