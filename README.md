# CS-506-TEMPLATE-base-repo

If your project has multiple teams add changes (code, deliverables, data, etc.) to your team folder.

Create a new branch from your team branch (ex. branch name: <code>team-a</code>, <code>team-b</code>,...etc.), add changes to your team folder (on the new branch you just created).

Open a Pull Request to your team branch (ex. branch name: <code>team-a</code>). Add your TA and TPM as reviewers.  ***Do not delete any team folders.***

At the end of the semester during project wrap up open a final Pull Request to <code>dev</code> from your team branch.

**Navigating Through Repository**

This repository contains multiple folders with content relevant to the folder's name. For example, the Heatmaps folder contains the dataset, heatmaps, and code used to generate the heatmaps. 

**Used Datasets**
The single dataset used in this project is https://data.boston.gov/dataset/311-service-requests/resource/dff4d804-5031-443a-8409-8344efd0e5c8 which we had downloaded as a CSV file.
We added an additional feature in this dataset for annual population at the time of the incident, this data is procured from Google which cites US Census Bureau as its source, among others. 

**Code Set Up**
Much of this code was run on Google Colab, so package installation was not required, however if running locally, then software libraries that are needed include pandas, matplotlib, folium (for heatmaps), and numpy.
