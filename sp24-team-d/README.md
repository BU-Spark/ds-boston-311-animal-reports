# City of Boston: 311 - Animal Reports - Team D

## Project Description
In recent years, urban areas have witnessed a significant increase in interactions between humans and wildlife, leading to a rise in service requests related to animals. The City of Boston, known for its rich history and dense population, is no exception. The Boston 311 service system, which allows residents to report non-emergency issues, has accumulated a wealth of data on such interactions. This report aims to delve into this data, focusing on animal-related requests, to uncover trends, patterns, and areas of concern that could inform policy, urban planning, and community education efforts.

## Project Objectives
The primary objective of this research is to analyze the nature and evolution of animal-related 311 service requests in Boston over the last decade. By examining this data, we seek to understand how urban wildlife interactions have changed over time and to identify factors that influence the frequency and type of these interactions. This analysis revolves around the following key questions:
